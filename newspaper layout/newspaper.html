                <h3>Delta coronavirus</h3>
                <p>India may now be past the peak of its latest coronavirus surge, but some other countries in Asia are experiencing rising infections. Meanwhile, vaccination rates across the region remain (with some exceptions) generally low, amidst concerns that the Delta variant is spreading.The World Health Organization (WHO) recently deemed the Delta variant, which originated in India, the "most transmissible of the variants identified so far".Some of India's immediate neighbours - Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - saw surges in infections in May (although they are now seeing downward trends in numbers.) Nepal was particularly badly hit, with a dramatic surge in infections overwhelming the local health infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Afghanistan's cases were at an all-time high in June and the country's health minister, Wajid Majrooh, said that 60% of cases in the capital, Kabul, were due to the Delta variant.The WHO has also recently reported rising case numbers in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Mongolia.Although it was earlier than other countries in starting a vaccination drive, the rollout in Bangladesh has generally been slow, and it had to suspend vaccinations in April.</p>

                <h3>Wimbledon 2021</h3>
                <p>Novak Djokovic beats Cristian Garin in last 16.Top seed Novak Djokovic continued his bid for a record-equalling 20th men's Grand Slam title with a routine last-16 win against Chile's Cristian Garin.Djokovic will play Marton Fucsovics in the last eight after the Hungarian beat Russian fifth seed Andrey Rublev.Against Fucsovics, Djokovic is likely to be tested more than he was against clay-court specialist Garin on Centre Court."I am delighted to reach the quarter-finals and I'm more delighted to see more fans on Centre Court," said Djokovic, who won in front of a crowd which has increased to 75% of the 15,000 capacity.</p>

                <p>After Djokovic had to fight off two break points in the second game of the second set, the Serb reasserted his authority to put pressure on Garin's serve and claimed the decisive break as he won the final three games.The 25-year-old Chilean came into the match with a 5-5 win-loss career record on grass and there was never any danger of that tipping in his favour.Djokovic raced through the third set with two more breaks of serve, wrapping up the victory in one hour and 49 minutes.The further the tournament goes I feel like I am more confident on grass and I look forward to the next challenge.</p>

                <h3>The World's Thinnest Techology</h3>
                <p>The World’s Thinnest Technology – Only Two Atoms Thick.A scientific breakthrough: Researchers from Tel Aviv University have engineered the world’s tiniest technology, with a thickness of only two atoms. According to the researchers, the new technology proposes a way for storing electric information in the thinnest unit known to science, in one of the most stable and inert materials in nature. The allowed quantum-mechanical electron tunneling through the atomically thin film may boost the information reading process much beyond current technologies.The research was performed by scientists from the Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Physics and Astronomy and Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Chemistry. The group includes Maayan Vizner Stern, Yuval Waschitz, Dr. Wei Cao, Dr. Iftach Nevo, Prof. Eran Sela, Prof. Michael Urbakh, Prof. Oded Hod, and Dr. Moshe Ben Shalom. The work is now published in Science magazine.</p>

                <p>“In the lab, we were able to artificially stack the layers in a parallel configuration with no rotation, which hypothetically places atoms of the same kind in perfect overlap despite the strong repulsive force between them (resulting from their identical charges). In actual fact, however, the crystal prefers to slide one layer slightly in relation to the other, so that only half of each layer’s atoms are in perfect overlap, and those that do overlap are of opposite charges — while all others are located above or below an empty space — the center of the hexagon. In this artificial stacking configuration the layers are quite distinct from one another. For example, if in the top layer only the boron atoms overlap, in the bottom layer it’s the other way around.”</p>
